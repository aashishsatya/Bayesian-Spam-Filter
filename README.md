# Bayesian Spam Filter

###### NOTE: Data sets haven't been included yet, will add them soon.
###### NOTE 2: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for Python is required.

An implementation of a Spam Filter in Python that uses the Naive Bayes Model to classify emails as spam or ham.

The program uses a small portion of NLTK to tokenize and clean out the "noise" words that may appear across the text.

#### Program Demo:

Simply run the script 'ClassifierDemo.py' once you're in the program directory:

```
python ClassifierDemo.py
```

As the results will show, the classifier has roughly 90% success in distinguishing ham and spam from hard ham mails.

#### Running the program:

You will have to uncomment the last few lines in the script Classifier.py. Then simply run the command

```
python SpamClassifier.py
```

and you should be good to go.
